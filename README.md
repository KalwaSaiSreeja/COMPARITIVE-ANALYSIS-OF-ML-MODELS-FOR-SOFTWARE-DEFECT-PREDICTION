## üìå Project Objectives

- Develop a Python GUI for software defect classification.
- Implement and evaluate Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, and Random Forest.
- Compare model performance with the WEKA tool.
- Analyze accuracy, F1-score, MAE, RMSE, and more.
- Identify the best-performing model for software defect prediction.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

### Python-Based GUI
- **Language**: Python 3.x
- **Libraries**: 
  - `PyQt5` (GUI)
  - `pandas`, `numpy` (Data Handling)
  - `scikit-learn` (Machine Learning)

### Benchmark Tool
- **WEKA**: Java-based platform for data mining and ML analysis.

---

## üìÅ Features

### ‚úÖ Python GUI Highlights
- Interactive GUI with two-panel layout.
- Supports loading training/testing datasets (CSV).
- Options to check null values and class imbalance.
- Dropdown model selection: Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest.
- Performance evaluation:
  - Accuracy
  - Confusion Matrix
  - Precision, Recall, F1-score
  - MAE, RMSE, RAE, RRSE
  - Kappa Statistic

### üìâ WEKA Usage
- Dataset preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- Same set of models evaluated for cross-comparison.

---

## üß™ Dataset Used

- **JM1 Dataset** from NASA's PROMISE repository.
- Dataset is split into train/validation/test (60/20/20).

---

## üìä Results Summary

- **Random Forest** consistently outperformed others in both environments (Python & WEKA).
- Results vary across datasets; performance is model- and data-dependent.

---

## üöß Limitations

- Only one dataset tested.
- No hyperparameter tuning or cross-validation in Python GUI.
- Visual outputs are text-based only.

---

## üîÆ Future Scope

- Add more ML models (e.g., XGBoost, SVM, Neural Networks).
- Support hyperparameter tuning.
- Add graphical evaluation (ROC, Confusion Matrix Heatmaps).
- Include k-fold cross-validation.
- Package GUI as an executable or web tool.
